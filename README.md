# Outside The Box MT4

## Description
This code is a sample implementation of the 'Outside The Box MT4' trading strategy developed by the Forex Robot Easy Team. This strategy aims to optimize forex trades by trading multiple currency pairs simultaneously.

The code consists of three main sections: 
1. A list of currency pairs to trade.
2. Trade management functions for opening and closing trades.
3. A backtesting function for testing the strategy using the MT5 platform.

## Currency Pairs
The following currency pairs are included in the strategy:
- NZDCHF
- GBPAUD
- GBPNZD
- GBPCAD
- GBPUSD
- NZDJPY
- USDJPY
- CHFJPY

## Trade Management Functions
The code provides two trade management functions:
1. `OpenTrade()`: This function is responsible for opening a trade. It takes parameters such as the symbol (currency pair), lot size, order type, stop loss, and take profit levels. You can customize this function to implement your own trade opening logic.
2. `CloseTrade()`: This function is used to close a trade. It takes the ticket number of the trade as a parameter. You can customize this function to implement your own trade closing logic.

## Backtesting Function
The code includes a `Backtest()` function that can be used to perform backtesting of the trading strategy using the MT5 platform. You can customize this function to include your own backtesting logic.

## Usage
The main `OnStart()` function of the code loops through each currency pair in the `CurrencyPairs` list. It opens a buy trade for each currency pair with a lot size of 0.01, a stop loss of 100 pips, and a take profit of 200 pips. It then closes the trade using the `CloseTrade()` function. Finally, it performs a backtest using the `Backtest()` function.

Please note that this code is a sample implementation and may need to be modified to suit your specific trading requirements.
